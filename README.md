# AI-Supported Early Childhood Activity Management System

This project is developed as part of an academic software engineering course.

The system aims to support teachers in early childhood education by assisting them in:
- Managing teacher and class profiles
- Planning and selecting appropriate classroom activities
- Receiving activity recommendations based on pedagogical rules and scoring logic

The project is designed in accordance with the system analysis and design report.

---

## Project Scope

This repository includes the implementation phase of the system described in the project report.

The system follows a modular and teacher-centered design approach and includes:
- User authentication (Teacher login)
- Teacher profile management
- Class profile management
- Rule-based and score-based activity recommendation logic
- Activity listing and reporting functionalities

---

## Development Approach

The implementation process follows an incremental and sprint-based development model.

- Each sprint targets a specific set of use cases defined in the report
- Development, testing, and bug tracking activities are documented
- Git is used for version control throughout the project lifecycle

---

## Sprint Plan

### Sprint 1
- Teacher login functionality
- Teacher profile management
- Initial project setup and repository structure

---

## Technologies (Planned)

- Front-end: Web-based UI
- Back-end: To be implemented
- Database: Relational database model
- Recommendation Engine: Rule-based + score-based logic
- Version Control: Git & GitHub

---

## Notes

This project prioritizes clarity, pedagogical appropriateness, and explainability over complex machine learning models.

Further features and improvements will be implemented in subsequent sprints.
